# Features

If the feature you wanted isn't listed in either of the two category, feel free to open an issue about it.

## What works in game
- Can play all main stories
- Can play all Side Stories and Intermezzis currently available in game
- Can play all anniliations
- Can play supplies stages that are opened on the particular day you are playing.
- Selecting skills when forming squads
- Editing squad formations
- Support units
- Changing unit's skins


## What doesn't work and why it won't be added support for (Open an issue if u want to convince me to add the feature)

### Settings default operators skills 
- This isn't your main option to play arknights + all settings will reset once you restart the game
- You can select the operator skills when setting up squads

### Leveling up operators or skills
- Change this via `edit.json` for now. (Until I make a UI for easy edit later on)

### Any base/profile/gacha/resource/store related stuffs
- Again, this isn't your main option to play arknights with. Go do them on actual server.

### Any contengency contract related stuffs
- Contengency contracts have stricter checks to prevent editing and I have no idea how the check works. Use [this](https://github.com/Loli-Killer/ArknightsCrisisSimulator) for now.
